## Updating the App Splash Screen

Flutter's [Adding a Splash Screen to Your Mobile App](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/splash-screen) documentation provides the most up-to-date and in-depth guidance on customizing the splash screen in your mobile app.

### Android Splash Screen

Within the `android/app/src/main/res` folder, replace `launch_image.png` inside the 

 - `mipmap-mdpi` 
 - `mipmap-hdpi` 
 - `mipmap-xhdpi` 
 - `mipmap-xxhdpi`
 
folders with the image asset you want featured on your Android splash screen. The `launch_image.png` you provide inside the `mipmap` folders should have an appropriate size for that folder.

The background color of your splash screen can be changed by editing the hex code value with `name="splash_background"` in `android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`.

### iOS Splash Screen

You should configure your iOS splash screen using an Xcode storyboard. To begin, add your splash screen image assets named 

 - `LaunchImage.png` 
 - `LaunchImage@2x.png`  
 - `LaunchImage@3x.png`

 with sizes corresponding to the filename inside the  `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.imageset` folder. 

Open your project's `ios` folder in Xcode and open `Runner/LaunchScreen.storyboard` in the editor. Specify your desired splash screen image and background by selecting those elements and editing their properties in the Xcode inspectors window. Feel free to further edit the splash screen properties in the Xcode inspectors window to customize the exact look of your splash screen.

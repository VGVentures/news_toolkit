# Flutter News Toolkit

The Google Flutter team and Google News Initiative have co-sponsored the development of a news application template. Our goal is to help news publishers to build apps and monetize more easily than ever in order to make reliable information accessible to all.

This template aims to **reduce the type to develop a typical news app by 80%**.

The Flutter news app template:

- Contains common news app UI workflows and core features built with Flutter and Firebase
- Implements best practices for news apps based on [Google News Initiative research](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/info/assets/static/docs/nci/nci-playbook-en.pdf)
- Allows publishers to monetize immediately with pre-built Google Ads and subscription services

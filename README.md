# Flutter News Toolkit

The Google Flutter team and Google News initiative have co-sponsored the development of a news application template. Our goal is to help news publishers to build apps and monetize more easily than ever.

This template aims to **reduce typical news app development time by 80%.**

The Flutter news app template:

- contains common news app UI workflows and core features built in Flutter and Firebase
- implements best practices for news apps based on [Google News Initiative research](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/info/assets/static/docs/nci/nci-playbook-en.pdf)
- allows publishers to monetize immediately with pre-built Google Ads and subscription services

To preview the [available features](#available-features) in this app, run the example app using this template in the [Flutter News Project](https://github.com/flutter/news_template/blob/main/flutter_news_example/README.md) folder by following the setup steps in the project's README.

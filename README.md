## Updating the App Launcher Icon

You can use the [Flutter Launcher Icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) package to streamline adding your new app launcher icon.

Alternatively, you may want to manually update your app's launcher icon. Flutter's documentation contains information on how to accomplish this for both [iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#add-an-app-icon) and [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#adding-a-launcher-icon).

# App Store Setup

This project supports Android and iOS. Follow the steps below to create apps to deploy to both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

## Google Play Store

### Create Apps

To create your Android apps, you'll first need to create or log into an existing developer account in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers). Under the `Users and permissions` tab, invite new users and grant appropriate permissions for your team. By default, you should generate a developer and production app for Android. If you chose to create additional flavors when generating your project from mason, create additional apps for each flavor.

### Configure App Information

Under the `Store presence` dropdown, select `Main store listing` to configure your app information. Populate the required fields under the `Store settings` menu as well. If you plan to offer a subscription package in your news app, [set up the subscription product](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/6749221870414263141/app-list) under the `Products` dropdown in the `Subscriptions` menu item.

## Apple App Store

### Create Apps

To create your iOS apps, you'll first need to create or log into an existing developer account in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/). Log into your [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login) account and select `Users and Access` to grant appropriate permissions to your team. Under `Apps`, create a developer and production app for your new project. If you chose to create additional flavors when generating your project from mason, create additional apps for each flavor.

### Configure App Information

Get started by populating the fields under the `App Information` menu for your app. Configure the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (EULA) in the `App Privacy --> Privacy Policy` section. Create the first release of your app to be able to setup subscriptions, which is later done in the `In-App Purchases` and `Subscriptions` menus. Follow [this link](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/) for more information about in-app purchases and subscriptions.

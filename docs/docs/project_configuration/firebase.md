# Firebase Setup

Your generated project includes sample configurations for Firebase. Please follow the instructions below to create your own Firebase projects and configure your apps.

:::note

Although the Flutter News Toolkit is pre-configured to work with Firebase, you're welcome to customize your codebase to leverage other services in your project.

:::

It is recommended to define at least two application environments: development and production. Each environment defines a different configuration of deep links, ads, and authentication along with a different entry point to the application (e.g. `main_development.dart`).

By default, your codebase should have support a production and development flavor. However, it's possible that you chose to create additional flavors when generating your project from mason.

In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/), configure separate Firebase projects for each flavor that your project supports (e.g. development and production). This can also be done using the [firebase-tools CLI](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) and the `firebase projects:create` command. In each Firebase project, create an Android and iOS app with appropriate package names. Make sure that development apps include the "dev" suffix. You may also do this using the `firebase apps:create` command.

Once configured, go to each Firebase project's settings and export the Google Services file for all apps. In the generated template, replace the content of all generated Google Services using exported configurations.
